# Hey there, I'm Hackmey 👋

Welcome to my cyber dojo where creativity meets code! I'm Arpit Rath—by day a coder, by night a ninja on a mission. Whether I'm breaking down complex problems or building epic projects, I'm all about mixing innovation with a dash of NINJA flair.

- **Ninja at Heart:** I slice through bugs and obstacles with stealth and style.

## My Tech Arsenal 🚀

I'm always leveling up my skills with a mix of modern tools and classic techniques:
- **Languages:** Java, Go, Python, JavaScript (and more when the mood strikes)
- **Frameworks & Tools:** React, SpringBoot, Git, and a few secret weapons only ninjas know about
- **Other Skills:** Problem-solving, Data Structures and Algotithms, and adding a sprinkle of cool to every project

## Current Missions 🎯
